# AutoPID

This is a fork of the [original AutoPID library](https://github.com/r-downing/AutoPID). I have applied the fixes from the open pull requests, and cleaned up the code a little.

Note: this has a different API than the original library. Rather than capturing output param pointers, it uses functions. Because of this, this library is not a drop-in replacement for the original.

A simple PID library featuring time scaling, bang-bang control, and PWM relay control.
